2. Address Negative Feedback: CCD should prioritize addressing common pain points identified in negative reviews. This could involve product improvements, staff training, or enhancing the overall customer experience.
3. Leverage Positive Reviews: Highlighting customer testimonials and positive reviews in marketing materials can enhance brand image and attract new customers.
4. Continuous Monitoring: Implementing a system for ongoing sentiment analysis will allow CCD to stay updated on customer perceptions and respond proactively to emerging trends or issues.
