,Ezhilkugan,3 months ago,Price has increased and quantity and quality has come down drastically. This small cup is the quantity for signature cold coffee and hazelnut cold coffee. At least they should maintain the taste for the brand. Everything was bland when we dined last including paneer sandwich. Pls do not visit this CCD.

The ambience still is great, however, sad that coffee at this shop, not the brand, is going down in it's  taste. I hope this was just a one time experience."

,Ragunandan Ganapathy,11 months ago,This place used to be maintained well long back. Now they are always understaffed and not opened regularly. They also start closing the store by 6.30pm instead of 11.00pm. Shelves are also all empty and only few beverages are available on counter. Better try other cafe places for evening meetings.
